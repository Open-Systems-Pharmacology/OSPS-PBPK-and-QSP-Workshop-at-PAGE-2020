# OSP Suite (PK-Sim® &amp; MoBi®) Workshops at the PAGE Meeting 2020 (June 9th and 13th, 2020)

## Two 1-Day PK-Sim® &amp; MoBi® workshops on PBPK and PBPK-based QSP 

esqLABS is running two hands-on **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** workshops on **PBPK and PBPK-based QSP** on **Tuesday and Saturday 9th and 13th of June 2020** as (pre & post) satellite meetings to the **PAGE Meeting 2020 in Ljubljana, Slovenia (Europe)**.

The workshops cover the **basics of PBPK**, **qualification of PBPK for regulatory purpose, PBPK for DDI and pediatrics** and the extension of PBPK with **customized organ physiology and pharmacodynamics**. The two workshops will enable participants to use **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** for PBPK in a regulatory setting (Day 1) and to build their very own PBPK-QSP platforms for the quantitative prediction of clinical trial outcomes by leveraging physiological and mechanistic knowledge to translate early in-vitro and preclinical outcomes to the clinic (Day 2). 

Within the two workshops, you will learn how to:

**Workshop 1 / Day 1:**
- [x] **Qualify PBPK models for intended use** using the [PK-Sim® qualification framework](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/shared-tools-and-example-workflows/qualification),
- [x] Learn how to **model drug-drug interactions** in PK-Sim (DDI)
- [x] Learn how to consider age-dependency in drug PK in PK-Sim (**Pediatric Analyses**)
- [x] Assess variability within **population simulations**

**Workshop 2 / Day 2:**
- [x] Integrate PBPK with **mechanism-based pharmacodynamics** in MoBi
- [x] Extend the PBPK physiology with **customized organs** in MoBi
- [x] Conduct **parameter identifications** in PK-Sim and MoBi
- [x] Run, plot, and analyze your PBPK-QSP models in **R**

The two workshops will be held by the consultants and scientists from esqlabs GmbH with extensive experience in the use of **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** in all application areas. 

While the workshop does not require any prior experience with PK-Sim® & MoBi®, many topics will be of interest even for advanced users.


## LOCATION

**Workshop 1 PBPK (June 9, 2020)**

To be announced (near the PAGE Meeting)

**Workshop 2 PB-QSP (June 13, 2020)**

To be announced (near the PAGE Meeting)

## REGISTRATION

You can register for each workshop separately or for both at a reduced price.

You can Register on Eventbrite:
- [Register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/qspc2020-pbpk-with-pk-sim-mobi-osp-suite-registration-86318114805) and select either: DAY 1 only, DAY 2 only, or BOTH days.

Each workshop day is currently restricted to 15 participants.

Registration includes coffee- and lunch breaks.

## AGENDA

The use-cases within the workshops will be based on published examples. 

We will develop PBPK models for small molecules for DDI and pediatric populations and PBPK models for biologics (antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)), which we develop into a PB-QSP model for treatment of tumor growth.  

The two workshop days are scheduled as follows:

### Day 1 (21st April, 2020)
